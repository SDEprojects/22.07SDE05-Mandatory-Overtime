You'd think you were a werewolf with the chili you brought last time!\n\nNow, that you're here we need to have a talk. You've had 13 complaints from MULTIPLE people in this office.  You are not only a disgrace as an employee, but as a person in general. You're inconsiderate, oblivious, and you smell. You make me sick %s.",
